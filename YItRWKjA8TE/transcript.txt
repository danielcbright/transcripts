when we have discovered as we have in the late 20th century that the fundamental entity that makes life work
is not just the matter the energy the chemistry it's the information then as
I've argued we're looking at evidence for an intelligent agency how do mathematical equations generate an
actual physical Universe of matter space time and energy that's completely unexplained in Quantum cosmology I think
what these Advocates of quantum cosmology have done is subtly support
the very idea they think they're disproving because if their theory is true then it's pre-existing mathematics
which is conceptual and intellectual it's ID they're pointing to the need for
a mind prior to the universe to make their whole system work and so the fine-tuning problem doesn't go away it's
just pushed out of view with the Multiverse the the the fine-tuning is explained by reference to a universe
generating generating mechanism that invokes prior unexplained fine-tuning

welcome to the conversations at the desk today in conversation with me is the noted American philosopher of science Dr
Interview Starts
Stephen C Meyer Dr Meyer who received his PhD in the philosophy of science from the University of Cambridge he's a
former geophysicist and college professor and currently serves as the Director of Discovery institute's Center
for Science and culture in Seattle he is the author of such books as the New York
Times bestseller Darwin's doubt and times literary supplement book of the Year signature in the cell and his
latest book is the return of the god hypothesis three scientific discoveries
that reveal the Mind behind the universe it makes a compelling case for the
existence of God arguing from crucial scientific advances in biology cosmology
and physics and we will be talking about the book about intelligent design theistic Evolution the Multiverse
hypothesis and more today welcome Dr Meyer to the show thank you for having me Asher so Dr Meyer talking about your
most recent book The Return of the god hypothesis um it goes over and Beyond some of your
previous writings to actually Encompass a few other facets and domains of
science to make a case for design and for a long time um the hypothesis of of God has been
snubbed from The Sciences uh probably it goes back to laplace's dogmatic
assertion that I don't need that hypothesis can you probably unpack The History of Science how did uh science
which largely originated from a Christian culture and Theological background but eventually what led to
the exit of God from the arena so to speak and what brings him back
that's a very good question and you'll see right away that the title of my book
invites uh a story it invites exactly the story you're asking about which is
uh first that the what we call modern science with its systematic ways of
Christian Roots of Modern Science
investigating nature first arose in a uh judeo-christian milieu in Western Europe
and scientists are historians of science describe a period they call the Scientific Revolution sometimes that's
dated from about 1500 to 1750 but I think increasingly historians now
recognize that the roots of that Scientific Revolution go back into the late Middle Ages and we'll date the the
whole of the revolution from Seven from 1300 to 1750 something like that in any
case you have figures like Boyle Robert Boyle and Sir Isaac Newton and Johannes
Kepler uh uh John Ray and many many others who
were first impelled to study nature in a very systematic way and it turns out as
you read their works you find that the motivation that they had for the kind of
study that they were doing was largely theological I have on my shelf behind me a book by
John Ray the wisdom of God uh manifested in the works of creation
as his famous title he was the founder of what we would call systematics today
uh the linnaean classification system was largely built upon his initial classification of plants and animals
John Ray went on to tutor Isaac Barrow who uh proved the first theorem of the
calculus and then tutored Newton who developed the calculus in its full Glory
um and all the other wonderful things Newton did so Ray was the tutor of Barrow Barrow was the tutor of Newton
and Ray was also among other things the
the founder of British natural theology the idea that by studying nature you could see the evidence of the handiwork
of God and all the scientists during this period had a concept that they implicitly employed to give them
confidence in studying nature and the concept was that of intelligibility the idea that nature could be understood by
a rational human Mind by the intellect of human beings because our minds have
been made in the image of the rational Creator who built his rationality and design into nature so there was a
principle of Correspondence as John polkinghorn the Cambridge physicist
priest of uh just if he just only recently died used to say the reason within matches the reason externally
without in the external world and so for that reason we can study nature and hope
to perceive its secrets and there were many other assumptions about the nature of God and the nature of the natural
world the nature of the physical world that gave these early founders of modern science
both an impetus to study nature and confidence that they could do so successfully and I write about them in
in my book so there are many historians who now see that that modern science is actually a kind of um a child of
Christianity and but in the Christianity uh of course affirming also the the
judaic roots of Christian belief uh The Book of Job was very important in to
many of the early founders of Science in formulating their concepts of the laws of nature for example so you have Jew
Jewish Jewish contribution to this you have a Catholic contribution from the medieval philosophers and a Protestant
contribution from the reformers who each contributing theological perspectives
that collectively gave rise to modern science in the 19th century that begins to shift though not entirely but um it
shifts significantly with figures like LaPlace as you mentioned uh the physicist who said said or at least is
rumored to have said said he had no need of the god hypothesis and then Darwin and uh and Marx later Freud and
so you've got to kind of by the by the early 20th century you get a comprehensive materialistic worldview
Darwin gives an account of where living things come from without recourse to any
intelligent design or guidance of any kind and so he has a theory of Origins Marx
has a theory of the future kind of a secular eschatology and Freud tells us
what to do about the human condition and our guilt and so these three great materialistic uh philosophers scientists
end up answering or addressing all the main worldview questions that traditional judeo-christian religion had
off had answered and all in the name of Science and so by the early 20th century
you have kind of a um consolidation of a world view known
as scientific materialism and that really has dominated the the 20th century but the argument in my book is
that that's beginning to shift because of scientific discoveries that were first made in the 20th century and have
continued to be reinforced by more recent discoveries right up to the present day and that I call the return
of the god hypothesis so you have a kind of Rise fall rise story if you're looking at it from a judeo-christian
point of view Judea Christian views give rise to modern science that
philosophical perspective is eclipsed in the late 19th century with the rise of scientific materialism and now in the
late 20th and early 21st century we have the evidence coming back that supports a
theistic view and that's the the burden of proof I bear in my book is to try to show that indeed in fact the title of your book
itself is quite provocative in that sense the return of the god hypothesis now the usual story or the narrative
that we hear today is that as most scientists progressed the scope for God
as a hypothesis uh even to be treated as a hypothesis that just goes down so
there's a gulf between the the popular public perception um that sign you know the perception is
that science leads to atheism and I think that you also discussed this in your recent article for the news week There's that Gulf between the public
perception about science and Atheism and what the scientific data actually says
and that's what you get in your book resist probably speak about that Gap
Science leads to atheism?
well right uh we still have these very popular scientific atheists uh they call
themselves the new atheists and they're essentially uh celebrity scientists who
have become spokesman for atheism and um they argue that uh that science
properly understood undermines belief in God Richard Dawkins famously wrote a
book titled the The God Delusion and his argument I I have always appreciated Dawkins because of the clarity with
which he frames issues I usually uh end up on the opposite side of the issue
from the good professor but he does a great job of framing the issue and
um he explains the the basic argument of for scientific atheism as
based on Darwin's theory he said that prior to Darwin the the most powerful
reason for believing in God was the publicly accessible evidence that we have of design and nature but he said
since Darwin's time we've known that that evidence of design is illusory it's
evidence of apparent design but not real design and it's apparent design because there he argues that there's an
unguided undirected process namely the darwinian mechanism of natural selection acting on random variations that
produces the appearance of design and living organisms without that process having been guided or directed in any
way so you have design without a designer is the darwinian formulation but if there's no designer then there's
no public evidence if there's no evidence for a designer there's no evidence public evidence for God and
therefore belief in God is still possible if you would like Dawkins says but it's essentially uh it's not based
on anything so it's essentially delusional and that's his title he's also said provocatively that the
Universe we observe has precisely the properties that we should observe
um uh if at bottom there's no purpose no design Nothing But Blind pitiless
indifference in other words undirected materialistic processes I love that framing because it it says first of all
that the metaphysical hypothesis of materialism is testable against what we observe in the natural world is it the
case that what we see in the natural world is exactly what we've expected now of naturalism or materialism were true
uh or is it not and I argue that it's not that we there are three big
discoveries at least about biological and cosmological Origins about the
origin of life in the universe that are precisely what we would not expect from blind pity listen difference or from
materialistic processes alone but instead they're what we would expect if in fact there were an intelligent
Creator who had the attributes that for example Jews and Christians and other traditional theists have long ascribed
to God uh yeah now just coming to the specific discoveries uh that you highlight in
your book um I've been noticing in fact preparing for this interview as well I've been watching some of your other
conversations and the kind of Engagement that the book is getting as well in fact earlier today I was watching your uh
exchange with Michael Sharma and he uh in in the starting part of the conversation he says and I quote he says
this is serious uh this is you know it's published by not just by Christian Publishers even Publishers like
harpercollins and many of the trader University presses are publishing works are like the one that we're talking
about and many of your colleagues um and he goes on to say that this is not your father's creationism you are
getting a hearing and this is being taken say seriously so um coming down
from the uh you know uh the old creationist arguments that that were once made the kind of argument that
you're making is a very sophisticated and pretty much bagged with signs and
also uh in in your most recent book you make a very holistic case for design furthering the case Beyond biology to
also incorporate aspects of physics and cosmology as well so despite the insistence of methodological naturalism
are all the relevant uh Sciences converging to make a unified case for design
well I think so I I would add though that I was um a little hurt by Michael's praise in
The Holistic Case for Design
that recent interview because you know I missed when they used to call us creationists and cheap tuxedos that was
teasing it was it was a very good conversation he's a very genial guy and it was it was a a serious conversation
and I and a respectful one so I appreciated him for that um I don't think he ever called us creationists and cheap tuxedos but you
can find that on the internet um that one bothered me because I paid a lot for my tuxedo I don't think it was
actually cheap but anyway uh yes back to the subject um yeah it is holistic but it's also a
uh is a cumulative and um incremental case because my first books
argued that for argue that there is evidence in biology
of a designing intelligence of some unspecified kind that in the digital code that we find in
the DNA molecule in the overall information storage transmission and processing system that we find in cells
in the molecular machinery and circuitry that we find in cells and animals we are
finding effects that we know from our experience arise from one and only one
kind of cause and that is an intelligence in mind um there's a wonderful past uh passage I
came across recently in the works of James Clark Maxwell the great 19th century physicist and he said the
conclusion of design follows directly from an application of the laws of thought
to the uh the uh phenomenon of our observation
and this is exactly the way I make the case what we observe we see things that
we observe that we know from our experience arise from one and only one type of cause one of the laws of thought
is the idea of causal adequacy you want to explain something you have to posit a cause which is known to produce that
thing that entity and the only kind of cause of which we know that produces digital code or complex circuitry or
functionally integrated Machinery is an intelligent agent and so in biology we
we see those types of of effects and we do not know of adequate materialistic
explanations for any of them that's part of the burden of proof that again I bear in the book and and I think I uh I'm
able to bear that burden um and so but we do know of a cause that
can produce for example the digital code uh the the kind the kind of information that we find in DNA and that is
intelligence so as a result of that kind of analysis I've concluded in my first
two books that we have powerful evidence of a designing agent of some kind playing a role in the origin and history
of life now my readers uh naturally wanted to know well what do you think about the identity of that designing
intelligence what kind of intelligence are we talking about are we talking about an imminent intelligence within
the cosmos AKA A Space Alien of some kind or are we talking about a Transcendent form of
intelligence beyond the universe uh something like God God or a space alien
and or are we talking about perhaps a different kind of God like a pantheistic
god or something that maybe an uh a deistic god what exactly what what are
we what's the best overall metaphysical explanation for the kind of evidence
that we have of design in life and I would add in the universe because that's what I did in the new book I added in
the evidence that we have from physics and cosmology about the origin and fine-tuning of the universe and argued
that if we bring that evidence in then the space alien hypothesis for
example become quickly can be shown to be inadequate uh no being within the
universe could could explain the fine-tuning of the fundamental parameters of physics that are set from
the very beginning of the universe and upon which that the origin and evolution of a future alien being would depend
that would get the cause uh after the effect which is nonsense similarly no no
alien intelligence could account for the singular beginning of the universe the
origin of the universe a finite time ago because again it's its origin would uh
would come much after the beginning of the universe it couldn't possibly be the explanation for the origin of the universe itself so when you bring in
those discover those other discoveries that the Universe had a beginning and that it has been finely tuned from
the beginning um an imminent intelligence ceases to be an adequate explanation but a Transcendent intelligence becomes an
even more compelling explanation and um and similarly materialism which I
think fails to account for the origin of the information needed to build the first life
um can't account for the origin of the universe either because the origin of the universe the origin the physical Universe of matter space time and energy
is what we're trying to explain and before there is uh and before there is a
physical Universe you don't have any matter that can do the the causing that can explain the origin of the material
Universe we're trying to explain the origin of matter after all and if um matter begins at a point in time
before that there's no matter to explain its or its own origin so I I argue I
look carefully at the competing scientific and worldview explanations that might be offered I argue that
materialism as a system of thought not just individual materialistic explanations but as a system of thought
is fundamentally inadequate to account for the origin of the universe itself
um so that's the kind of argumentation that I engage in I use a lot of Bayesian logic I use a method of recently known
as inference to the best explanation so I use a lot of tools that come out of contemporary philosophy of science
to evaluate the competing hypotheses and and come to the conclusion that that a
theistic designer a designer that has the attributes of transcendence intelligence volition and
um and I would argue great power is what is necessary to account for the three
great discoveries that we see the origin the the idea that the Universe had a beginning it's been finely tuned from
the beginning and there have been big infusions of information into the biosphere since the beginning so we need
an active intelligent Transcendent Creator to explain all three of those things no one day your holistic case has
been getting these rave reviews and engagements from leading experts in the
Jordan Peterson's Question
field as well as several notes good public intellectuals Jordan Peterson for instance took to Twitter a couple of
months back praising the book as difficult densely informative and well written he quotes a particular excerpt
from the book without functional criteria to guide a search through the vast space of possible sequences random
variation is probabilistically doomed he followed up with another tweet another
question is this an accurate claim he makes the case very carefully it's
not often that I encountered a book that contains so much that I did not know
he seems to be very intrigued by the case for intelligent designs explanatory
advantage over random mutations to explain the origin of genetic information
could you summarize the case here what Peterson is exactly referring to and also probably evaluate the alternate
evolutionary mechanisms out there to account for the same right that's a a
technical portion of of uh all three books I addressed this question of the
um creative power of the mutation selection mechanism with respect to the need to
produce new information let me give a quick uh analogy that will
clarify the nature of the problem and then maybe we'll dive a little deeper into it um we now know that DNA contains
information in a digital form that it uses a four character alphabet or Co or
set of characters to convey information this was Francis crick's famous sequence
hypothesis in 1958 Watson and Crick elucidated the double helix structure of the molecule in 53 in 58 Crick working
on his own suggest that the the four uh chemical subunits that run along the interior of
the molecule called bases or nucleotide bases are functioning like alphabetic
characters in written text or like the zeros and ones in a section of software code
his hypothesis is eventually confirmed uh it took five it took about seven
years seven or eight years of intense work in a period we call the molecular biological Revolution but by 1965 a
molecular biologists had elucidated what they call the gene expression system or the system for protein synthesis and
they realize that in fact the the sequence of bases on the DNA on the spine of the DNA molecule were providing
information for directing the construction of proteins and protein machines inside the cell so you had mechanic you had digital information
directing the construction of mechanical systems um very similar to our modern CAD cam
technology that we use in manufacturing today uh so that raised a huge question which
is where does all that information come from and if you think about what mutation and
selection do uh natural selection Works after the fact of a successful random
search for a new variation okay so the creative part of the mutation selection
mechanism is the random part it's not the it's not natural selection natural selection is simply a sifting mechanism
but finding the new code to build a new protein has to occur first by random
mutation now if the number of possibilities that need to be searched is large compared to
the number of uh possibilities which will produce a functional alternative
um then that mechanism may be doomed probabilistically it may not it
will not there will not be enough time to search the haystack in in search for
the needle the haystack's too big the needle it tucked away in too small a
corner of it then the odds are you're going to fail rather than succeed
and what has been shown mathematically by a molecular biologists who worked on
this question the technical name for it is the the issue of the the Rarity of genes and proteins in sequence space how
rare are functional genes functional sequences in relation to all the gibberish sequences if the overwhelming
majority of sequences are gibberish then probabilistically a random search is going to hit one of those and not find
the the thing you want so here's now here's the the easy to understand analogy if we have a section
of computer code and we start randomly changing the zeros and ones
will we be more likely what will that computer code be more likely to degrade
the function that's there and destroy it or find a new functional program or
algorithm well when I ask that question rhetorically to computer programmers they they laugh because they know that
after very few changes the code might tolerate a few random changes but after
very few you're going to destroy any function long before you get to a new
programmer or operating system and now the same thing has been shown experimentally in the case of of Gene
sequences uh if you start to change them randomly between 3 and 15 mutations are
sufficient to make sure to to degrade the resulting protein into a state of uh
of uh instability thermodynamic instability and so the the uh we know empirically that the
mutation selection mechanism is therefore not an effective means of generating new genetic information not even enough genetic information to build
one new functional protein mathematically the reason for that is there are so many more ways to go wrong
than there are to go right and one molecular biologist who's worked on this Douglas ax who did 14 years of research
on this at Cambridge University found that the ratio of the functional sequences to non-functional sequences in
even a short relatively modest length protein is one over 10 to the 77th power
so there's only 10 to the 65th atoms in the Milky Way galaxy quickly get a sense
that um probably a random search is going to be probabilistically doomed to find
um a non-functional sequence not a functional one even taking into account the four billion years of of of
um of biological history on planet Earth the the the price precise way of saying
this is that it's overwhelmingly more likely that a random search even supplemented with natural selection
will fail in finding one new gene or protein in the known time of life on
planet Earth than it is that such a search would succeed so the failure is overwhelmingly more probable than
success in which case positing such a mechanism as the as the explanation for
the origin of information is overwhelmingly more likely to be false than true and we want best explanations in science
not ones that are more likely to be false than true certainly not overwhelmingly more likely so I I spell
out this very careful probabilistic it's a kind of second order probabilistic reasoning and it spelled out very
carefully in uh both signature and the cell and Darwin Stout my first two books
and then I reprized that in shorter form in Return of the god hypothesis and
address various objections that have been been um offered and and show those to be
inadequate as well in fact what I'm able to do in the new book is cite some of this new work by an
Israeli protein scientist Dan toffic who showed that if you start randomly
changing sections of a gene you will degrade the resulting protein within between 3 and 15 mutations and
that's not nearly enough to generate a whole new protein so you're going to degrade function long before you find
new function bad mechanism doesn't have the creative power to generate new information that's
the bottom line mutation so uh out of curiosity have did you get
a chance to probably discuss this with Peterson uh himself or uh we did have a
short exchange on his Twitter uh when this came out um because he asked if anyone uh he he asked his followers does
my is Meyer correct about this problem of of um of Rarity of genes and proteins
in sequence space and the difficulty of a random search and a couple people made very facile responses saying oh no no he
doesn't know anything this is completely wrong but didn't really offer much of an explanation so I then in 250 characters
tweeted a a tight summation of of the argument and uh so you know we'll we'll
we'll we'll see I haven't had any further opportunity to discuss but we were obviously encouraged since uh
Jordan has such a following and he's such a thoughtful such a thoughtful person yeah yes yes so um within the
speed of evolution um of late there is a kind of
um alternate set of theories that are emerging be it extended synthesis or uh
and such and what do you what do you make of the theistic evolution case that is presented from uh evolutionary
ID vs. Theistic Evolution
paleontologists like Simon Conway Morris sure uh well let's start with the alternative theories of evolution that
are being proposed because that's I think what's really interesting about what's going on and Conway Morris uh
actually uh sort of intimated that this was coming years ago he said that neo-darwinism
um is is effectively well Stephen J Gould said it was effectively dead Simon
said we were living in a post darwinian World a post neo-darwinian world uh and
that is to say that it is now widely recognized among evolutionary biologists themselves that the mutation natural
selection mechanism that we were talking about just a minute ago lacks the creative power to generate fundamentally new forms of life we've analyzed that at
a very deep uh uh molecular level applying concepts of informational
analysis to the the understanding the problem but even at a More macroscopic
Level The evolutionary biologists have recognized that uh the mutation and
selection does a great job of explaining small scale variations but it does not
give an adequate account of large-scale morphological Innovations fundamentally new changes in form
new Anatomy new physiology new body plans are not well explained by mutation and selection so that's that's commonly
accepted among evolutionary biologists the question then is what to do about it and there have been a number of
different new evolutionary theories or mechanisms proposed either to
uh complement or supplement the mutation selection mechanism or to Simply replace
it all together and in my book Darwin's doubt in chapters 15 and 16 I look at six or seven of
these uh new evolutionary theories or mechanisms and in the theistic evolution
book you mentioned we take on a couple of other yet newer ones that have come down the pike the fact that there are so
many is indication of the ferment that has now beset the field there is no
dominant view because really none of these views can explain the information problem and what I show In Darwin's
doubt is that these new views either do not address the information problem or they Explain the origin of biological
information by presupposing other prior unexplained sources of information
thereby simply Shifting the problem out of view but not ultimately solving it what we know from experience is that it
takes a mind to generate information if we're talking about a software program Bill Gates has said that DNA is like a
software program but much more complex Flex than ever any we've ever written Richard Dawkins says the DNA is like a
machine code uh Leroy Hood characterizes it the great biotechnologist he just
simply calls it digital code well what we know about the origin of digital code of software is it always comes from a
programmer we know that information in a digital or alphabetic or typographic form always arises from an intelligent
Source whether we're talking about a hieroglyphic inscription or a paragraph in a book or information in a radio
signal information is a product of mind and so when the when we have discovered
as we have in the late 20th century that the fundamental entity that makes life
work is not just the matter the energy the chemistry it's the information then
as I've argued we're looking at evidence for intelligent agency in the history of life and
um and that's that's the problem that Neo Darwinism has been unable to solve
it turns out that the other models of evolutionary theory or other evolutionary mechanisms also failed to
solve that problem some sweep it under the rug some avoid it some push it out
of view some beg the question but none of them take it head on and one of the reasons for that is precisely this
extreme Rarity of genes and proteins and sequence space um but there are other aspects to that
as well so there's something called the waiting times problem which is essentially an information problem
um and there's this problem of of the extreme isolation in sequence space the
the protein forms are very different from one another the stable forms are different from one another in their
underlying sequences that make them possible so you start to change one sequence and you degrade the form that
you have long before you rise up out of the non-functional valley to a new fitness Peak because there's some
sometimes called to a new stable form and none of the evolutionary mechanisms
solve that problem interesting so in fact to the viewers um in his books Dr Meyer does address or
explain the waiting time problem and and have several other challenges that are hotly discussed in in the field today uh
moving on in the interest of time um to the other domains of science that
you interact with in the return of the god hypothesis so in your previous two books it's largely designed in biology
that you're dealing with but in this book what is fascinating is the holistic case that that it it it it puts forth so
one of the key discoveries that you cite that occasion the return of the god hypothesis is the evidence for a cosmic
beginning uh however we often hear Skeptics time and again challenging the implications
of big bang cosmology often drawing from Quantum cosmology to down downplay the
um the absolute beginning of the universe more recently the images uh from the James Webb Telescope were used
James Webb Images & Big Bang
by internet Skeptics to have disproven the big Bank uh what do you make of such attempts and do these claims hold any
eventual weight um the the let's dispatch with the James Webb
um concern right away I have an article posted at the daily wired and also on my
website uh addressing the alleged claim that or the the claim alleged that the
uh alleging that the the images from the James Webb undermined the Big Bang
uh cosmology and the idea of an expanding Universe in fact the opposite
is true and what the what's going on there is that a single researcher named Eric
Lerner who is an independent researcher he doesn't have a PhD in physics uh but
he's done a lot of work advancing an alternative cosmology he calls plasma cosmology has he's been writing
skeptical things about the Big Bang since the 1990s he had a book called The Big Bang never happened and he seized on
some interesting anomalies as far as our ideas about Galaxy formation it seems that the there were
more galaxies uh in the very very most ancient time period of the universe that
the James Webb has been able to detect than we would have expected now it turns out that what he's doing is conflating a
challenge to Galaxy formation with a challenge to the expanding Universe because the James Webb actually has
detected the very long wavelength uh infrared radiation that would be expected
um if the universe had expanded as much as it as The Big Bang Theory would
expect during that very long time period from the earliest part of the universe till
now backing up um we we first learned about the
expanding Universe because of light coming from distant galaxies that was stretched out the scientists the
astrophysicists call that red shift shine light through a prism it separates into red to Violet the red light has
longer wavelengths the violet to Blue shorter wavelengths if an object is
receding from us then the way the wavelength of light will will stretch
out and will look redder than it would otherwise look in spectrographic analysis
um that's what was found of nearly all the galaxies that we observed in all quadrants of the night sky redshift
suggesting an expanding Universe outward roughly in a roughly spherical roughly spherical way now that's that
observation is held up not only from the first observations that were
made with Hubble's 100-inch telescope that he worked with at the Palomar observatory in the 1920s but with images
from the Hub the later Hubble telescope that was built in his honor and and the
Spitzer telescope uh what the James Webb is able to do is to look yet further out in space and
farther back into time to look at what galaxies would have looked like in the very earliest uh
period of the universe after the big bang and it has in fact found such galaxies
and it has and as best we can tell to this point well the light coming from
those galaxies is super stretched out as I I've called it Uber redshifted it's into the infrared range and the reason
that this has to be the case this is obviously the case because the James Webb Telescope was built to detect such
infrared radiation that there are any galaxies of that age to talk about shows
that the James Webb has detected galaxies with a kind of radiation that we would expect to be coming from such
very very distant very old objects it only can detect these the super old or
the it's it's detecting this infrared radiation and using that radiation to uh
synthesize images of very ancient galaxies and the Very fact that it's able to do that is showing us that we're
getting the kind of radiation that we would expect based on the idea of an expanding Universe outward from a
beginning I.E The Big Bang Theory now learner recognizes that but he tries to explain that radiation away with a with
a discredited idea known as the tired light hypothesis and I explained in the article why that idea has been
discredited so he actually acknowledges the evidence that on its face supports expansion of the universe but he he
shunts that aside and then confuses the issue of Galaxy formation and the issue of evidence that would confirm an extra
expanding universe and what the evidence we have might challenge our theories of Galaxy formation it doesn't challenge
our ideas about the or the expansion of the universe great um going to the second part of
Quantum Cosmology & Universe from Nothing
that question uh drawing a lot from Quantum cosmology let's say uh you know there are different interpretations of
of quantum mechanics and some interpretations are largely used by Skeptics even on the internet to claim
that the Universe could have just popped out of popped into existence from let's
say a Quantum vacuum how do you respond to that well this is the universe from nothing idea of Lawrence Krauss or the uh idea
he popularizes the work of Alexander velenken that's one version of quantum cosmology the other version is the
Hawking hartle uh model of quantum cosmology Hawking in his popular books claimed
that he got rid of the singularity at the beginning of the universe he had proven The Singularity based on general relativity but said wait maybe if we
have a different theory of gravity operating when the universe is very very very very very very tiny and Quantum
effects needed would need to be taken into effect then maybe we would have a quantum theory of gravity so he develops
one but there are a couple of Curiosities about what he develops that I think actually undermine the idea that
it that Quantum cosmology can be used to refute a god hypothesis or a cosmological argument for the existence
of God first is that in his technical work uh with hartle Hawking doesn't get rid of
the The cosmological Singularity it's presupposed in all the work and secondly his explanation for the origin of the
universe is a purely mathematical one he posits laws of a law of quantum gravity
or it's really a it's really not a single law it's a kind of mathematical apparatus it's a there's something
called the wheeler DeWitt equation which if solved in a particular way gives something called a universal wave
function and if the universal wave function includes a universe like ours as a possible outcome
then the quantum cosmologists will say aha we've explained the origin of the universe
so you've got these three mathematics you've got these you've got a big big hairy equation which is kind of the
analog to the Schrodinger equation in in quantum physics and as a kind of rudimentary theory of
quantum gravity then if the theory if the equation can be solved to give a wave function which
would um describe a range of possible universes that could emerge
and if among those possibilities is a universe like ours the quantum cosmologist says Hey we've explained the
origin of the Universe from literally nothing physical but what does Explain the origin of the
universe is all is this whole mathematical apparatus but we'll do it equation the universal wave function and
the boundary constraints they place on the wheeler DeWitt equation to generate a universal wave function that will give
them the answer they want so Alexander valencan has observed has
made a very provocative remark he said um he said well
what tablet are these equations written on these physical laws
before there's matter space time and energy what could these things be describing
um where are they where do they reside this is the realm of pure mathematics and since mathematics
uh is something that's conceptual that exists in a mind are we really saying that a mind predates the universe
and I think he's onto something very important and Hawking himself tumbles to it he says what puts fire in the equations that give the that gives them
a universe that makes a universe to describe how do mathematical equations generate an actual physical Universe of
matter space time and energy that's completely unexplained in Quantum cosmology instead it seems to have a kind of
implicit uh kind of tacit theistic implication uh
because in our experience math doesn't cause things to happen we use math to describe things
Hawking has also said that there is a law such as gravity explains why there
is something rather than nothing or why the How the Universe came a universe came into existence from nothing well
um that the law is purely is purely is purely conceptual at this point it does
not laws of physics don't cause things to happen they describe what they don't
cause matter and energy to happen they describe what matter and energy do once they've come into existence so I think
what these uh Advocates of quantum cosmology have done is subtly support
the very idea they think they're disproving because if their theory is true then it's pre-existing mathematics
which is conceptual and intellectual it's IDE they're pointing to the need for a mind prior to the universe to make
their whole system work and it there's also a technical point that to solve this big hairy equation called the
wheeler DeWitt equation to get a universal wave function that will include a universe like ours very
specific what are called boundary constraints restrictions on degrees of mathematical Freedom have to be chosen
by the mathematician or the physicist to get the outcome you wants so it's actually what they're actually modeling
is a teleological process where there's an input of information from a mind in
order to produce a mathematical solution that will suggest that our universe is plausible or probable
and that I think there I think they inadvertently model the need for intelligent design
this is a big this is a complicated subject and one that takes a little more time to explain really clearly but I
think I do that in the book so P if you want a very thorough critique of quantum cosmology
then chapter 17 and 18 in my book take this on head on and but in short what I
show is that if the if quantum cosmology of quantum cosmological models are the
correct models for the origin of the universe they inadvertently Provide support for the theistic hypothesis uh
the god hypothesis so when you talk about the absolute beginning of the universe we are indeed
talking about the beginning of all things that the scientific structure or the scientific method itself uh would
depend on um so would you agree with a cosmologist like um martial gliser when they say
that When approaching this problem we're actually approaching the natural limits of science the very end of Science and
and this this whole domain of the question of Beginnings is not something that science can ultimately answer
well it depends on what we how we Define science if we mean by science the ancient concept of skiencia uh knowledge
I think we can have uh we can't have uh and as philosophers we think of
knowledge as Justified true belief I think we can posit a god hypothesis and
provide justification for belief in that hypothesis now it might be I I'm very
happy to concede in the book that the the god hypothesis is a metaphysical or philosophical hypothesis but where you
but doesn't mean we don't know things we can't know it to be true um and so if we're talking about simply
analyzing the material Universe we do reach a limit because the material universe itself comes into existence and
if that's your definition of science then yes science has come to to a limit but it doesn't mean that we can't think
about what best explains the origin of the material universe as revealed by
science and there I think theism provides a better explanation than repeating worldview explanations indeed
any possible materialistic explanation because after all before the origin of matter there's no matter to do the
causing so just as is the case with the case for Cosmic Beginnings several
theories have been postulated also to explain the fine tuning of the universe the most popular one is the Multiverse
Theory so what is your view on the Multiverse its evidential status as a
Multiverse & Fine-tuning
rival hypothesis and implications well I think this the Multiverse is an inadequate explanation for the fine
tuning um the fine tuning again is um
the idea that there are uh there is an ensemble of separate physical parameters
that uh fall within very narrow ranges and have to do so in order for there to
be a life conducive universe and even for there to be basic chemistry in the universe
um and so um many physicists have concluded that
the most common sensical explanation for the fine-tuning is a fine tuner it looks like the universe was a setup job
because there's no underlying physical or logical reason that these parameters have to be the exact have the exact
values or strengths that they have you can't explain them by the laws of nature because it's the laws of nature themselves that are among the the finely
tuned physical parameters that we're talking about so um so the idea has insistently Arisen as
one physicist said that we're dealing with evidence of a supernatural agency uh Fred Hoyle who was an atheist before
he discovered some of these fine-tuning parameters said a common sense interpretation of the data suggests that a super intellect is monkeyed with
physics and chemistry to make life possible so um so that's the common sense
interpretation the alternate view is that well maybe the extreme improbability of getting all these
parameters to strike so that life could possibly exist in the universe is evidence that there were many many many
other universes maybe billions of other universes so many in fact that eventually the correct combination of
factors would have had to have Arisen in one of the universes and we just happen to be in that lucky universe
now the there's a problem with that form of reasoning and that is that if these
other universes are causally separate from ours if they're causally disconnected from ours then whatever
happens in those other universes has no effect on anything that happens in this universe including whatever
parameters or whatever processes that were in play or at work that set the
fine-tuning parameters in the first place so simply positing other universes doesn't actually change the
probabilities of uh associated with the fine-tuning parameters in this universe
unless there is some causal connection or underlying common cause that would
allow the Multiverse proponent to portray our universe as the lucky winner of a giant Cosmic Lottery if however
there is an underlying Universe generating mechanism that's spitting out universes one after another then we can
say well okay whatever is at work in that Universe generating machine is
affecting is is allowing us to generate a probability distribution of
the different possible parameters and so in fact uh on the basis of two
speculative cosmological models modern proponents of the Multiverse have advocated for two Universe generating
types of universe generating mechanisms one based on string theory one based on something called inflationary cosmology
and that's where the the rub comes in for the Multiverse proponent because it turns out that those Universe generating
mechanisms themselves have to be finely tuned to produce new universes
uh even in theory these are highly speculative cosmological models uh that
that allow you to think about new universes arising but even in theory the universe generating mechanisms must be
finely tuned for the mechanism to uh have a have a a reasonable chance of
generating new universes and so the fine-tuning problem doesn't go away it
just just pushed out of view with the Multiverse the the fine tuning is explained by reference to a universe
generating generating mechanism that invokes prior unexplained fine-tuning
and so in conclusion to this long answer the Multiverse hypothesis doesn't
provide an ultimate explanation for fine-tuning and yet we do know of a cause that does generate finely tuned
systems that causes intelligent agency what we mean again by fine-tuning is an
ensemble of parameters of improbable parameters that work
together collectively to achieve some discernible outcome or functionally significant outcome so we could think of
things in our experience that are finely tuned internal combustion engines or computer hardware and software working
together or a French recipe or we could go on but all these things have in common a single type of cause and namely
an intelligent one and so since the fine-tuned since the Multiverse doesn't
explain the ultimate origin of fine tuning but we do have a causal explanation for fine tuning generally
intelligent design stands I think is the best explanation for that phenomenon and the Multiverse fails now that's
Is Intelligent Design Pseudoscientific?
interesting because even cosmologists like sabanos and Felder for example have even gone on to the extent of labeling
the Multiverse hypothesis as pseudoscience now I find that pretty interesting because well the Skeptics
postulate the Multiverse also as an explanation for the fine tuning of the
universe but also for the very existence of the universe and on the other side intelligent design posits God so this
has been also a common charge against intelligence design its critics often allege that it's a form of pseudoscience
now I know that this whole term pseudoscience will have to you'll have
to touch upon issues of the philosophy of science like the demarcation problem but very quickly I'd like to know how do
you uh how do you see this whole uh charge yeah it's an attempt it's an attempt to
stigmatize an idea without ever engaging the arguments for or against it and that's one of the reasons that the use
of terms like pseudoscience I think is unfortunate because it doesn't it tends to buy us a a discussion or a narrative
before there's actual evaluation of the evidential Merit for a conclusion or an inference
um it also trades on as you mentioned the demarcation problem if you say something
is not science or if it's pseudoscience or if it's metaphysics rather than
science that presupposes a definition of science presupposes a way of defining science and that that is actually a
hotly contested issue the issue of how to define science and it has not been settled and a big part of my work has
been on looking at different types of scientific methods because typically we want to say science is special because
of its methods but in fact there are different methods of scientific reasoning and discourse and I think the
case for intelligent design very nicely meets the criteria of a good
historical scientific theory it uses a distinctively historical scientific method of reasoning it is testable in
the same way historical scientific theories are it's as scientific or unscientific depending on which
definition of science you want to apply as competing darwinian or evolutionary ideas so the attempt to settle a a
scientific theory by reference to definitions of science I think is is the
wrong way to go the the way to settle an issue is by looking at the evidence and then addressing the arguments pro and
con uh here's my take on all this stuff about pseudoscience and metaphysics versus science the the question isn't
how you categorize a um an argument or an inference or a theory
or an idea the question is whether or not the idea or Theory or inference is
justified by the evidence and therefore likely to be true uh so I think
um the Multiverse is Let's Be I'm happy to call it a metaphysical hypothesis I'm
happy to call the god hypothesis a medical is a metaphysical hypothesis but that doesn't mean that we can't reason
carefully about those competing hypotheses and decide which one provides a better explanation for for example the
fine-tuning evidence both have been positive for reasons that are discernible and and and and and
uh logical as explanations for the fine-tuning one provides a causal he had
a good explanation the other doesn't so I prefer I think there are reasons to prefer the theistic design hypothesis
for the fine-tuning over and against the Multiverse hypothesis
um the Multiverse does not have the character of most physical theories I grant that so I know why Sabine is
saying that and if she wants to call it pseudoscience or metaphysics or a metaphysical hypothesis masquerading as
a scientific it doesn't matter what what you call it how you classify an idea is kind of irrelevant what we want to know
is do we have warrant for believing it to be true or not is it the best
explanation a good explanation or an inadequate explanation um I think in this case the better
explanation the best explanation we have is theistic design the Multiverse is a poor explanation it's inadequate it's
causally inadequate because it begs the ultimate question and never answers it um it's also a hugely in violation of
Occam's razor and I go into that and in in depth in the book as well so
um I I appreciate sabine's skepticism about the Multiverse I'm not myself
concerned to classify things as uh metaphysics pseudoscience philosophy
religion science I'd ultimately don't care about that I
think what I care about is is warrant and um comparative explanatory power what's
the best explanation however it be classified thank you so much Dr Maya for your time
and this was a fascinating conversation um you know your answers were very precise and and thank you again for your
time thank you for being on the Carpenters desk thank you for having me on and uh it's great to talk to you it's
such a distance Take Care thank you
